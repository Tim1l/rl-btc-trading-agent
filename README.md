# RL BTC Trading Agent üöÄ

A state-of-the-art reinforcement learning agent for BTC/USD trading, crafted over 8 months with a custom PPO environment and advanced feature engineering. This proprietary model leverages 80 high-signal entry points, multi-timeframe analysis, and a sophisticated reward function to deliver robust performance across market conditions. The repo showcases the infrastructure: data pipelines, execution, and logging.

## üåü Technical Innovations
- **Custom RL Environment**: PPO-based with action masking, processing 35,000+ parameters/step across M15, H1, H4, D1 timeframes.
- **Feature Extraction**: Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with 64-256 channels, dilations [1,2,4,8], and sequence length 480, capturing multi-TF dynamics.
- **Policy Network**: 512-128-128 layers, enhanced by gradient hooks for stability and anti-overfitting design.
- **Value Network**: Residual connections (128-512-384-256-128), layer normalization, and dropout (0.25) for robust value estimation.
- **Reward Function**: Proprietary, optimizes 100-600 min holds, balances long/short entries, and prioritizes high-signal trades (80 entry points with 60% win rate at TP=SL=ATR).
- **Observations**: Comprehensive state with 53 indicators (OHLC, RSI, ATR, EMA, HMA) and environment metrics, fully normalized.
- **Compute**: GPU-optimized, achieving 150-220 FPS on A100 across 16 parallel environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure
- **Data Pipeline**: Fetches high-res BTC/USD candles (2017-2025) via Bybit/MT5 APIs, with advanced normalization and imputation (`get_last_candles.py`).
- **Execution**: Seamless Bybit/MT5 integration with optimized low-latency execution, 10% position sizing, -3% stop-loss, 0.04% commission (`trade_on_bybit.py`, `trade_mt5.py`).
- **Trading Logic**: 80 high-signal entry points derived from market patterns, achieving 60% win rate at TP=SL=ATR (see `enter_points/`).
- **Monitoring**: Detailed trade logs and signal analysis (`log_example.txt`).

## üß† Challenges Overcome
- Mitigated gradient explosion/vanishing with custom gradient hooks and optimization.
- Engineered proprietary reward function to balance long/short entries and enforce 100-600 min holds.
- Ensured zero overfitting via RL design and out-of-sample validation.
- Processed 35k+ parameters/step across 2017-2025 data.
